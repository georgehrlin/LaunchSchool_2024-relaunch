The program will output: `These hashes are not the same!`.
My reasoning is that hashes are also ordered lists, so the order of the key-value pairs inside the two hashes matters when they are compared. On ther other hand, the old or new way to format the hashes should not matter in comparison. [WRONG]

CORRECTION: The two hashes are the same! Comparison of hashes in Ruby do not factor in the order of their key-value pairs.
