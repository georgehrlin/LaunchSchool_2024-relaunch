This code snippet raises the error because it is missing an `end` on line 6 to close the if statement. The fixed version would be:

```ruby
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end

equal_to_four(5)
```

CORRECTION: Precisely speaking, the error was due to the `end` on line 6 being matched with the `if` on line 2, so the method definition that begins on line 1 was missing an `end` to close it off.
