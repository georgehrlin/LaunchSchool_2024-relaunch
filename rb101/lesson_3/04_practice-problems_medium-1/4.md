Q: Is there a difference between the two, other than what operator she chose to use to concatenate an element to the buffer?

A: There is a significant different between the two.

`rolling_buffer1` mutates the original array object that is passed in as an argument by appending the object that `new_element` points to and calling `shift` on it if the conditional is met.

On ther other hand, `rolling_buffer2` does not mutate the original array object. Instead, it returns a new array with `new_element` appended and `shift` called on it if the conditional is met.

Official Solution (Parts of)
The first implementation returns a reference to the object passed in as the `buffer` argument, while the second returns a new object.

Furthermore, the first implementation mutates the argument given by the `buffer` argument, while the second does not mutate its `input_array` argument.
