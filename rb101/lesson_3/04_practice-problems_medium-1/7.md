A: The family's data did not get ransacked.

Inside `mess_with_demographics`'s definition, `values` is called on the argument hash. `values` returns a new array, so all the operations in `each`'s block did not have an effect on the original hash. **[INCORRECT]**

### Correction
While it is true that `values` does return a new array, the elements that this new array contains are actually the same objects within the original hash that `values` was called on.

Therefore, `mess_with_demographics` actually successfully mutates the values of the value hashes of `munsters`.
