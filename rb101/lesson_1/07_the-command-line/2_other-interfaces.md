Introduction to Command Line

# Other Interfaces
Thre are some commands that you'll use on the command line that will completely change the context of the command line. In fact, these commands provide entirely new tools that can help you to interface more directly with files, to query databases, to experiment with scripting languages, or to manage your system.

Each of these commands provide an entirely new interface:
- Database management: `mysql`, `psql`, `redis-client`, `mongo`, etc.
- Text editors: `vim`, `pico`, `nano`, `emacs`, etc.
- REPLs: `python`, `irb`, `node`, `php`, etc.
- System monitoring: `top`, `htop`, etc.
- Reading files or manuals: `man`, `less`, `more`, etc.
- Window/session handling: `byobu`, `screen`, `tmux`, etc.

While on the command line, use `bash`, `zsh`, or similar to create a new nested shell interface. Then type `exit` to exit the nested shells.

# Overview
### The command line is an interface to your computer's files and directories.
### Everything you do in the command line is related to files, directories, and executables.
### Environment variables provide context for what you do in the command line.
### Access to files, directories, and executables is determined by their read, write, and execute permissions. There are permissions for the file's user (owner), group, and other.
### Some programs provide a completely new context within the command line interface.
