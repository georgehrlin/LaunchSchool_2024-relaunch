Q: What are mary's permissions for the `napkins` file in the following outputs?
```shell
$ groups mary
mary travelers vip
$ ls -l custodian_closet
total 0
-rw-rw----  1 acmeair acmeair 0 Jul 21 17:57 napkins
-rw-rw----  1 acmeair acmeair 0 Jul 21 17:57 paper_towels
```

A: `mary` has no permissions for the `napkins` file because `mary` does not belong to the `acmeair` group, and no permission is assigned for `other`.
