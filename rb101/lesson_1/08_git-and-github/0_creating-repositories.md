## `.gitignore`
`.gitignore` is a list of files and/or directories that you do not want included in yoru repository. Git will not allow you to add any of the files referenced in `.gitignore` to your repository. `.gitignore` lives in the current Git repo's directory and paths to ignored files and directories should be relative from that directory.

```
# Ignore all SQLite databases in the db directory
db/*.sqlite3
# Ignore all DS_Store files generated by macOS anywhere in the repo
.DS_Store
```
