Q: Why does the below code output `Hello` rather than `Goodbye`?
```ruby
def greet(greeting)
  return 'Hello'
  greeting
end

str = 'Goodbye'
puts greet(str)
```
### My Attempt
The code outputs `Hello` rather than `Goodbye` because, within the method, the keyword `return` is used with the string `'Hello'` passed to it as an argument. Once the execution of a method runs into a `return`, the method returns the value passed to the `return` and quits immediately. Therefore, no matter what value is passed to method `greet` as argument, it will always return `'Hello'`.

### Answer from the Article
The following code outputs `Hello` due to the explicit `return` command on line 2.
When used within a method, the method immediately terminates at the location of the command, returning its argument value. In this case, `'Hello'` is returned from `greet` and output by invocation of the `puts` method.
