Q: What will the code below output and why?
```ruby
def countdown(starting_num)
  loop do
    puts starting_num
    starting_num -= 1
    break if starting_num == 0
  end

  puts 'Blast off!'
end

countdown(3)
```
### My Attempt
This code will output:
```shell
3
2
1
Blast off!
```
On line 11, method `countdown` is called and gets passed `3` as an argument. This binds the method parameter `starting_num` with `3`.
Within the method, the keyword `loop` is used on line 2 to create a loop. Within the loop: On line 3, `puts` outputs the value `starting_num` points to; on line 4, `starting_num` is reassigned the result of it minus `1`; on line 5, the `break` keyword is used and will be invoked if `starting_num`'s value is equal to `0`.
Because `starting_num` first points to `3`, `3`, `2`, `1` will be output by line 5, then `starting_num` will be reassigned `0`, and the `break` on line 5 will be invoked, breaking out of the loop.
Once out of the loop, execution moves on to line 10 and outputs `Blast off!` on the console.

### Answer from the Article
On line 11, the `countdown` method is invoked and gets passed the integer `3` as an argument, binding it to the method's parameter `starting_num`. Within the method, the `loop` method is called and gets passed a `do...end` block as an argument, creating a loop from lines 3-5. Upon each iteration of the loop, the current value of `starting_num` will output, decrement by `1`, then terminate the loop if its value is `0`. Because its original value is `3`, the loop will execute 3 times, outputting `3`, `2`, and `1`, followed by `Blast off!` from the `puts` method invocation on line 8.
