```ruby
def add_5(number)
  number + 5
end

a = 5
p add_5(a)
```
### My Attempt
On line 5, local variable `a` is initialized to reference the integer object `5`.
On line 6, method `add_5` is called with the object that `a` points to passed in as an argument.
On line 1, method parameter `number` is assigned `5`. On line 2, method `+` is called on `number` with `5` passed in as an argument, thus line 2 returns `10`. Because line 2 is the last line of expression in the method, `add_5(a)` returns `10`.
On line 7, method `p` is called with `10` passed in as an argument. This returns `10` and outputs `10` on the console.

### Answer from the Article
On line 5, local variable `a` is initialized and references the integer object `5`.
On line 6, the `add_5` method is invoked and gets passed `a` as an argumet, binding its value to the method's parameter `number`.
Within the method, the `+` method is called on `number` and gets passed the integer `5` as an argument, returning the integer `10`. Because this is the last line of the method, `10` is returned from `add_5` and gets passed as an argument to the `p` method invocation, outputting it to the console.
