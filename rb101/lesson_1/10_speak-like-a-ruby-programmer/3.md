Q: What does the below code output and why?
```ruby
str = 'cat'

def say
  str = 'meow'
end

puts str
```
### My Attempt
This code outputs `cat` on the console.
On line 1, the local variable `str` is initialized to refernce the string object `'cat'`.
From line 5 to 7, a method `say` is defined.
On line 9, `str` is passed as argument to `puts`. Because method definition has its own self-contained scope, the initialization of `str` on line 4 has no effect on the local variable initialized on line 1. Therefore, line 7 outputs `cat` on the console.

## Answer from the Article
The following code outputs `cat`. This is due to variable scoping rules in regards to methods, which states that methods have their own, self-contained scope that cannot access local variables initialized outside of it, nor the other way around. Because both `str` local variable are located within different scopes of the `say` method, they are considered different variables. The `str` on line 7 is outside of the method's scope, and therefore references the value assigned on line 1.
