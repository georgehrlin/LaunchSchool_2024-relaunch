"`break` accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is “breaking” out of."

What value `break` sets the return value to for the while loop depends on the variable (or the value) that is passed to the `break` keyword along with the condition.

**Official Answer**
`break` returns `nil` when no arguments are passed to `break`, or the value of the argument when an argument is provided.
